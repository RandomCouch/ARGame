# ARGame


Packages used:

ARFoundation - Used to implement AR functionality for both Android and iOS, however this project was only developed and tested on Android, but attempting an iOS build is welcome.

How to play : 

On the first screen, pick a stage and press continue.

In the calibration screen, scan around the room while focusing on the floor to detect the surface of the floor. Once you see a few planes you can tap on them to spawn the selected stage in AR. 
Once spawned, you can use the left slider to change the stage rotation, and the right slider to change the stage scale.
When you are happy with stage placement, press the confirm button. 

In the AR game, you have a semi transparent helper cube attached to your camera, bring this cube close enough to the 3d sphere on the bottom left corner of the stage, when that sphere becomes green you will be able to tap and hold on your screen to drag the sphere around using your device. The sphere also controls the 2d circle, which travels through the maze. 

The objective is to get the circle from the start to the end, without touching the walls! 

Enjoy
